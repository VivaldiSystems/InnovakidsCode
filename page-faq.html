                <p>Innovakids is designed to change they way we teach and learn.  The system requires the teacher and administrators to change their paradigm of education.  Teachers are coordinators of Education for their students.  Orchestrating the learning process by managing the system.  The administration of Innovakids is primarily in the setup area.  Once the students have been imported or added, classes are created and scheduled, and lessons have been scheduled, you allow Innvakids to take over, monitoring student progress, helping individual students when needed and reviewing the analysis.  The idea is that you eithor assign or create and assign the lessons that the students need to master then allow the students to proceed at their own pace.  Your job then takes on the role of evaluating and monitoring the progress of each student.  If a student falls behind then you are notified that intervention is need and Innovakids will suggest various remedies.  Innovakids will also automatially assign prerequisite lessons to the student once a gap in basic understanding or fundamental knowledge is triggered.</p>

It critical that each teacher consider sharing their lesson for us to achieve this goal.  The idea is to create an Open Lesson World, allowing students from all over the world the opportunity to gain the experience of great lessons no matter where they live.  We at Innovakids allow teachers and students to evaluate each lesson allowing teachers to not only find lessons that fit their grade level but filter these lessons by evaluation score, topic, standard, grade level or teaching methodology. </p>

So if we are going to implement technology then it must be able to improve student learning.

                <p>Hand in hand with question two is this one. Innovative technology must improve instruction. It can not be a burden on teachers or an after-thought by them. Innovative technology must become part of the fabric of instruction so that the teachers become more efficient and effective at how they motivate, engage and instruct students. If it’s not going to improve instruction and they do not know how to seamlessly infuse it into their lessons, you will not get the support of the teachers and they won’t use the technology.

                <p>Here is the fork in the road with technology innovation and implementation. You can have answers to the first three questions and feel like you are on the right track, but the innovation will become useless if you do not provide the training for teachers and students, and information sessions for parents. We cannot assume stakeholders will understand the reasons for the innovation, how it can be used, and most importantly, how to use it properly. We need training and information sessions early and often before, during, and after implementation.

                <p>Technology is changing by the minute and the pressure to be innovative accelerates the timeline for implementation. Be realistic, talk to other schools and districts about their process of implementing similar innovations, and learn from their successes and challenges. Then establish a timeline with clear objectives that can be met, a comprehensive professional development program, trainings for students, and information sessions for parents. Poor planning and rushed timelines are recipes for implementation disaster.</p>
